# real-time-object-detection-with-ssd
This project implements a pre-trained network (SSD with mobileNet)
to achieve the real-time object detection task with realsense camera.

There are different scripts in this project served for different purposes.

## rs_camera_realtime_object_detection_ssd
This script implements the ssd network to achieve the object detection with
realsense camera (D435I)

## rs_camera_realtime_object_detection_ssd_with_selfbuildpackages
Similar as the previous script but called a self-defined class named ssd
in the network_ssd script to runs the deep-learning algorithm.

You may refer to the codes for a more detail description.
